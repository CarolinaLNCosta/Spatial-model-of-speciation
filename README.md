# Spatial-model-of-speciation

Individual-based model (IBM) of species evolution in a spatially explicit approach.

This code was the result of a research project developed in my PhD with Professor Dr. Marcus Aloizio Martinez de Aguiar (IFGW - UNICAMP, Brazil).

The results of this research were published as a paper in Systematic Biology Journal: 

Carolina L N Costa, Paula Lemos-Costa, Flavia M D Marquitti, Lucas D Fernandes, Marlon F Ramos, David M Schneider, Ayana B Martins, Marcus A M de Aguiar, Signatures of Microevolutionary Processes in Phylogenetic Patterns, Systematic Biology, Volume 68, Issue 1, January 2019, Pages 131â€“144, https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syy049

The input.in file is an example of input data to run the ibm.f90 code. To run ibm code, please, follow the instructions in the README_for_ibm file.

All files are also available in the Supplementary Material in https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syy049.
